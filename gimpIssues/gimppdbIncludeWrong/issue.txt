2.99 compile error in meson build on Alpine; /app/pdb/gimppdb.c unnecessarily includes core/gimpmarshal.h

Reproduce:  on Alpine distribution using meson build, compile with ninja -j 1 .
On compiling /app/pdb/gimppdb.c the compiler gives the error "file /core/gimpmarshal.h does not exist"

Probably this error has not been seen before because the build order is different on other platforms.

If you delete that one include line from /app/pdb/gimppdb.c, the compile succeeds.

app/core/gimpmarshal.h is a generated file.
app/pdb/meson.build doesn't declare that pdb/gimppdb.c build time depends on the generated file.
If instead you want to keep the include (for some reason) you could fix the app/pdb/meson.build, see !324 :

```
libapppdb_sources [ ..., appcoremarshal[1]]
```

By the way, Alpine.org builds and packages GIMP but evidently not 2.99 and not using the meson build.
