Select>Distort fails w/ gimp message "unbound variable gimp-item-is-channel"

Test case
=========

File>New
Make a rectangular selection
Select>Distort...
expect a dialog
Choose OK button.

Expect:
   See https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/script-fu-distress-selection.html

   The selection assumes a jagged edge?

   (Note the plugin's own docstring says "distress",
   the plugin is named                   "distort"
   and Gimp help says the effect is      "deform")

Actual:
 Gimp Message dialog: "unbound variable gimp-item-is-channel


Fix
===

In plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/distress-selection.scm:
gimp-item-is-channel => 
gimp-item-id-is-channel

gimp-item-is-channel is not in the PDB for 2.99.  I couldn't easily find the commit where that changed.

script-fu values seems to usually be ID's.  I don't have a deep understanding of script-fu.


Other
=====

This also fixes unreported issue with Filters>Decor>Coffee stain,
which calls distress-selection.scm

Test case:

File>New
Filters>Decor>Coffee Stain...
expect a dialog
Choose OK

Expect:
     See https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/script-fu-coffee-stain.html
     Three new layers showing coffee stains.
Actual:
    Same error message as above
