2.99 ScriptFu plugins give error 'unbound variable' for calls to obsolete PDB procedures

This is an omnibus issue, for a set of similar symptoms caused when a plugin
calls a renamed PDB procedure
e.g. "unbound variable image-is-valid" where the PDB procedure is now "image-id-is-valid".

The attached .txt files describe the issues in detail and how to replicate/test.

The attached .diff files are patches.

Please let me know if you prefer a different process for submitting patches to 2.99.

I have detected about a dozen other issues with scriptfu scripts.
Using a plugin that tests all the scriptfu scripts.
I plan to publish that plugin and to submit more issues/patches.
