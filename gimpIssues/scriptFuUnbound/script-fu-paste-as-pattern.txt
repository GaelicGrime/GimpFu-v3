Edit>Paste as>New Pattern...  fails w/ gimp message "unbound variable gimp-image-is-valid"

Test case
=========

(Similar to "Paste as>New Brush issue.")

File>New
Make a rectangular selection
Edit>Copy
Edit>Paste as>New Pattern...
expect a dialog
Choose OK button.

Expect:
   A new pattern "My Pattern" exists.
   Visible in the Patterns pane, looks like the selection.
   New file in Gimp resources.
   Gimp reloads patterns resources.

Actual:
 Gimp Message dialog: "unbound variable gimp-image-is-valid"


Fix
===

Fix is very similar to "Paste as>New Brush issue."

Test case depends on issue: 5313 file-pat-save-internal
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/5313
for which there is no patch yet.
