Edit>Paste as>New Brush...  fails w/ gimp message "unbound variable gimp-image-is-valid"

Test case
=========

File>New
Make a rectangular selection
Edit>Copy
Edit>Paste as>New Brush...
expect a dialog
Choose OK button.

Expect:
   A new brush "My Brush" exists.
   Visible in the Brushes pane, looks like the selection.
   New file in Gimp resources.
   Gimp reloads brush resources.

Actual:
 Gimp Message dialog: "unbound variable gimp-image-is-valid"


Fix
===

Fix 1
-----
In plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/paste-as-brush.scm:
gimp-image-is-valid =>
gimp-image-id-is-valid

gimp-image-is-valid is not in the PDB for 2.99.  I couldn't easily find the commit where that changed.

script-fu values seems to usually be ID's.  I don't have a deep understanding of script-fu.

Fix 2
-----

The first bug hides another issue later in the script: wrong signature to PDB procedure file-gbr-save:

In plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/paste-as-brush.scm:
change signature.

The signature of many file save/load PDB routines changed:
a) in the "file" parameters, from two string filenames to one
b) in the "drawable" parameter, from one drawable to two parameters: len, drawable


Other
=====

The test case will not succeed until the patch for "ScriptFu unknown types" is also applied.
See #5402   https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/5402

This patch contains some changes to whitespace, that have no effect in the Scheme language.
