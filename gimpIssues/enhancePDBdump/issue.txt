Enhance: improve type names printed by PDB procedure gimp-pdb-dump

Currently, for each arg of a PDB procedure it prints the type of GParamSpec e.g. "GParamObject."
It should print the type of the GValue which the GParamSpec describes, e.g. "GFile" or "GimpDrawable."
What it currently prints is vague and incomprehensible to most readers.
What is should print is what the PDB Browser prints.

To implement this requires a few changed lines in app/pdb/gimppdb-query.c
(new code lifted from libgimp/gimpprocview.c that implement PDB browser.)

```
output_string (string, G_PARAM_SPEC_TYPE_NAME (pspec));
=>
output_string (string, g_type_name (G_PARAM_SPEC_VALUE_TYPE (pspec)));
```

It has been suggested (in the comments for !214)
that the procedure be removed from GIMP.
It seems there is code duplication
since there are two places that print text for a PDB procedure,
in app/pdb/gimppdb-query.c and in libgimp/gimpprocview.c.
I will open another issue for that.
