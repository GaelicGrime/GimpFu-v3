Enhance: show stack trace for crashing plugins

By design, Gimp does not open a debugging window (showing a stack trace) for faulted plugins, which are separate processes.
I recall reading this design prevents flooding gimp.org with bug reports for third party plugins.

Example:

TODO not sure this is correct
