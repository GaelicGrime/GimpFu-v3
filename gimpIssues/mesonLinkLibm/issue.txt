Meson build using lld linker fails: missing dependency on libm for libgimpwidgets/test-eevl

This is a trivial issue with build system, use case: meson, clang, lld.

Symptom: build stops with linker error: unresolved symbol 'pow' when linking test-eevl, which is an executable for testing.

Analysis: libgimpwidgets/test-eevl.c does include math.h and so depends on the system math library (libm usually)
but libgimpwidgets/meson.build does not declare that dependency.

Patch attached.

More specifics:
Gimp 2.99 pulled a few days ago
Ubuntu 20.04 with installed packages [meson, clang, lld]
I am attempting to build with address sanitizer asan.

Build command is:

env CC=clang CXX=clang++ CC_LD=/usr/bin/ld.lld CXX_LD=/usr/bin/ld.lld LDFLAGS=-shared-libasan meson _build \
 --buildtype=debug \
 -Djavascript=false \
 -Dlua=false \
 -Dpython=true \
 -Dgtk-doc=false \
 -Db_sanitize=address

I looked at Gimp's CI build using clang.  I can't explain why it seems to work while this build doesn't.
Possibly that build uses a more recent debian-testing container and version of clang.

Even after fixing this, the build stops at another issue, g-ir-scanner seems to invoke gcc instead of clang,
but passes clang style warning options, and stops.
