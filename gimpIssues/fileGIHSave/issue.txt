2.99 Plugin file-gih-save (save animated brush) has multiple issues.

1) When called NONINTERACTIVE, at line 415 it accesses its parameter with index 8,
but it should be index 9 (the index of the "select" string array.)

2) It registers with a parameter whose blurb is "Short description of the gihtern".
  This is actually the "Name of the brush" ?
  I think that "gihtern" is gobbledygook, meaning nothing to most people.
  Probably a pasting error.

3) It registers with an int argument called "dimension-2".
   And documents it must equal an earlier parameter "dimension."
   And the code checks that they are equal.

   The argument is really the count of the strings in the "select" string array?

   This illustrates why a PDB API that requires a length be passed for each array
   is confusing to users.  (See issue #5919 for discussion or an alternative and demo code.)
   In this case, the plugin has only one "dimension",
   and all the arrays must have that dimension.
   Requiring a separate and repeated parameter for that length is baffling to readers of the API.
   The plugin could just as well
   get one "dimension" argument (which makes sense to users)
   then get the length of the array *by asking the array object*
   and then check the requirement that all the lengths are equal.

   When the GUI for a plugin is generated automatically,
   (which it is not in this case)
   the GUI would not be user friendly,
   requiring the user to enter the same value over and over.

   Here the plugin author is disguising what the argument is,
   by just renaming it "dimension-2".
   But its not a second dimension as in "2D",
   its just a repeat of the only dimension.
   At least to me, it is confusing.
   (I could be wrong, the plugin also has "columns" and "rows",
   maybe it is 2D and I am confused.)

   With MR !389, a string array knows its own length, the API does not need to require
   the length passed separately.
