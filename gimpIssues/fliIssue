2.99 Export then Import a "Autodesk FLIC animation" i.e. fli format fails for image with only one layer i.e. frame

Exporting an image with only one layer creates a file that in turn cannot be Imported.
This is of little consequence, since no one would want to create an "animation" with only one frame.
The issue hinders automated testing, since calling the PDB save procedure with a minimal image and default parameters
runs into the issue.


Replicate:

```
Start Gimp.
Create a new image (having only one layer)
Choose File>Export.
In the dialog, option menu "File type",  select "Autodesk FLIC animations"
Choose OK button.
Expect dialog to close and another dialog to open.
Leave the parameters (first and last frame) having the values 1, and choose Export button.
Expect dialog to close and file "Untitled.fli" to be created.

Choose File>Open on "Untitled.fli", etc.
```

Expect: image opens
Actual:

Gimp message shows:
```
Opening '/work/Untitled.fli' failed:

AutoDesk FLIC animation plug-in could not open image
```




My analysis:

in gimp/plug-ins/file-fli/flik-gimp.c line 553:

```
if (from_frame >= fli_header.frames)
  {
    /* nothing to do ... */
    fclose (fp);
    return NULL;
  }
```

The ">=" should be ">"
In the test case, from_frame is 1 and fli_header.frames is 1.
I lightly tested.



Context:

Self-built Gimp 2.99 b5659e8aa45e9ecc8888cc7ca212c661c5dbf9eb
Meson build, on Ubuntu19.10, in a container.
I discovered this running a Python plugin that exercises all the PDB save/load procedures, where possible.
