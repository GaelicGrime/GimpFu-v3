2.99 Select>Distort... throws Gtk-WARNING

To replicate:

```
start Gimp in a console
File>New, choose OK
Select>Distort..
```

Expect:

Dialog to open without error messages in console

Actual:

Dialog opens, apparently with all text correct, yet...

In console: (script-fu:160): Gtk-WARNING **: 14:01:29.658: Failed to set text '_Threshold (bigger 1<-->254 smaller):'
from markup due to error parsing markup: Error on line 1 char 33: ?--? is not a valid name

(If instead, you first export G_DEBUG=fatal-warnings, then the plugin crashes,
and subsequently, item "Select>Distort" is no longer in the menus.)

Analysis:

In plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/distress-selection.scm appears the text "<-->".
Apparently the "<>" confuses some parser used by GTK, trying to parse something like XML or HTML?
But without apparent effect on the result.

This is the only place in Gimp that the notation "1<-->254" appears to be used in the GUI.
I think the notation "1-254" conveys the same meaning.
It would be nice to not have warnings and to have uniform or conventional notation in the GUI.
So this is only a user interace issue.
But to change the notation would require many translations to be updated?




Context:
Ubuntu 20.04
Self-built latest gimp using automake
