>Can I ....squash and force push yourself?"

Yes, I can and will, ASAP.  (I learned how on my last MR.)


"Are these unrelated issues" carve-it and chrome-it

Yes, unrelated.  AFAIK this MR completely fixes this issue.  But carve-it and chrome-it are broken by other issues,
hidden by this issue.

chrome-it calls gimp-file-load with two strings instead of one, issue 6842.
(I am working on an MR for that issue.)
(I can't put a # in front of the issue, else closing this MR will close the issue.)

carve-it calls gimp-edit-copy with a single drawable instead of a len, GimpObjectArray issue 6026.
For which I submitted MR !439 (that I fear you will reject, but instead it can be fixed in the script.)

Both those cases (and there are other similar cases) are easily fixed in the Scheme script itself (not in C lang ScriptFu machinery.)


It is good that you are thorough, and I want to stress that I am also.
I test all the scripts in the GIMP repository
(a minimal test, that success is returned, for somewhat arbitrary arguments,
I can't say that the script functionally succeeds because that would involve comparing the returned images.)

I know most of the outstanding issues with GIMP scripts.
Except that one bug may hide another, so I may find more.

A few other small scriptfu/script issues already identified: 6841, 6839
