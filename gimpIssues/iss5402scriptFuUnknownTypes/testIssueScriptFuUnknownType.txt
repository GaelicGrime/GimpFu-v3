Test cases for changes to script-fu/scheme-wrapper.c :

1a.  unknown type GimpObjectArray
1b.  unknown type GFile

Both can be tested with Edit>Paste as..>Brush
i.e. plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/paste-as-brush.scm
(However, also requires another fix to paste-as-brush.scm
to an old signature for PDB procedure file-gbr_save.
Said fix not in this patch.)

File>New
Make a selection
Edit>Copy
Edit>Paste as>New brush...
expect dialog
change filename
change brush name
Choose OK
Expect:
   Gimp reloads brushes
   Gimp shows new filename loaded in console
   New brush with new name in Gimp brushes pane

2.  unknown return type GimpObjectArray

Test with Layer>Stack>Reverse layer order
i.e. plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/reverse-layers.scm
