Test cases for changes to script-fu/scheme-wrapper.c :

1a.  unknown type GimpObjectArray
1b.  unknown type GFile

Both can be tested with Edit>Paste as..>Brush  i.e. plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/paste-as-brush.scm
(However, also requires another fix to paste-as-brush.scm
to an old signature for PDB procedure file-gbr_save.
Said fix not in this patch.)

2.  unknown return type GimpObjectArray

Test by creating two layers then Layer>Stack>Reverse layer order
i.e. plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/reverse-layers.scm
