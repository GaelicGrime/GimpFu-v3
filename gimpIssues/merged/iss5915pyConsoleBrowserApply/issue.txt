2.99 Python Procedure Browser "Apply" button throws NameError: name 'pdb' is not defined

```
Start GIMP in a terminal
Choose Filters>Development>Python-Fu>Python Console, expect a dialog
Choose the Browse button, expect a dialog
Choose Apply button
```
Expect: the selected (highlighted) procedure name to be pasted into the Python Console and executed (I think.)

Actual: doesn't happen, and terminal shows:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gimp/2.99/plug-ins/python-console/python-console.py", line 149, in browse_response
    proc = pdb[proc_name]
NameError: name 'pdb' is not defined
```

Analysis:
Probably a vestige of eliminating GimpFu from v3.
"pdb" is the alias that GimpFu provided for what is now Gimp.get_pdb().
So the fix is probably to substitute "Gimp.get_pdb()" for "pdb",
in more than one place, not just line 149.

(I could submit a patch, but I am preoccupied.)
