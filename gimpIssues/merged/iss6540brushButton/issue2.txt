2.99 From plugin, call GimpUi.BrushSelectButton.get_brush() fails, annotations wrong

#6540

In Python:

```
name, opacity, spacing, paint_mode = self.get_brush()
```
where self is a GimpUi.BrushSelectButton.

Expect: work.

Actual: fail, probably TypeError expected x args, received y (sorry, forgot to capture it before I fixed it.)

Analysis:

Currently the annotation does not indicate out parameters.
Also, the body of get_brush() suggests that out parameters are optional.
The body is like:

```
if (opacity)
  *opacity = button->priv->opacity;
```

Which, to me, means the "opacity" arg is an out parameter, optional.

I think the annotation should be:
```
 /**
  * gimp_brush_select_button_get_brush:
  * @button:                        A #GimpBrushSelectButton
  * @opacity:    (out) (optional):  Opacity of the selected brush.
  * @spacing:    (out) (optional):  Spacing of the selected brush.
  * @paint_mode: (out) (optional):  Paint mode of the selected brush.
```

I will submit a MR to that effect.
