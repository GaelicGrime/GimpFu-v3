This MR fixes #6842 in all scripts in the GIMP repository
*that I can find in my test harness or using grep*

Other instances might be found later (but are easily fixed later.):
- other outstanding issues may hide some unfixed instances from the test harness.
- the grep is not foolproof.

*The touched scripts may still fail for other outstanding issues.*
For example, for API changes for multi-layer.
Which will be fixed in separate commits.

Generally, the fix is to calls in scripts to:
- file-gbr-save
- file-pat-save
- gimp-file-load
- gimp-file-save

i.e. calls to the PDB procedures whose Scheme signature has changed
str, str => str (where the C type is now GFile instead of gchar*)

The fix is simply to delete the second str.
In most cases the second str
is "" or the same as the first str.

The branch is off of the branch for MR !437.
I can submit a diff instead.
But you can't test this without !437
