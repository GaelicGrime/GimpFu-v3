2.99 PDB procedure gimp-edit-copy crashes when passed wrong array length

Symptom:

```
... omitted
clipboard: sending pixbuf data as 'image/png'
/usr/local/bin/gimp-2.99: fatal error: Segmentation fault

```

Replicate:

In a scriptfu plugin, use this scriptfu construct:
```
(gimp-edit-copy 1 ())
```
Where 1 is the length of the array and () is an empty list that scriptfu marshals to a GimpObjectArray
(with changes I am making for #5402).
This is new signature for gimp-edit-copy, for multi-layer.
Note that the stated length is 1, but the actual length is 0, so its a mistake
by the author of any such script.
But it shouldn't crash GIMP.

Bad Python plugins could also pass wrong arguments when calling the PDB,
GI is not assisting then.

Discussion:

I don't think that scriptfu should be sanity checking the arguments,
the checking should be deeper.

Deeper in the code at gimp/pdb/groups/edit.pdb (the source for gimp-edit-copy)
there doesn't seem to be precondition code to check this case.

Please see #5919, which I wrote 5 months ago.
Briefly, it proposes the PDB API be object oriented, not passing the length of arrays as a separate argument.
I can elaborate on the proposed changes and arguments made in #5919 if necessary.

This issue adds to the argument for #5919
- this issue would be moot, you don't need to check that the length argument is correct if you don't pass it.
- the changes for #5402 could also more easily ameliorate #6026,
  with scriptfu converting a single scheme value into a GimpObjectArray (but still deprecate).
  (More easily: its just a tiny bit harder to convert one value into [length, array])
  (If you even want to support deprecated API in scriptfu, its only a few lines of code.)

Context:

Self-built very recent 2.99, meson build, Ubuntu, with my incipient MR code for #5402.
