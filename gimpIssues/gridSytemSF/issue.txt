script-fu-grid-system

Not self-documenting.

Briefly says it wants list e.g. '(1 g 1)'

Does not say what g means.

Provides its own system of defaults.
The default provided to PDB is a string that is a name in the SF environment.

Removed from the menu system by Simon Budig.  See ChangeLog.pre-2.4.

Even if restored to menu system, the default shown in the GUI would be meaningless?
