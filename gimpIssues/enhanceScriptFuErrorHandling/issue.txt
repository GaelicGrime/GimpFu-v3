Enhance ScriptFu error handling to fix these issues:

1. omits domain on g_set_error which throws
GLib-WARNING **: 11:29:10.711: (../../../glib/gerror.c:412):g_error_new_valist: runtime check failed: (domain != 0)

2. On many script error messages, fails to provide useful details.
For example, "Invalid type for argument"
fails to say:
- what formal Gimp type was expected (e.g. Gimp.FloatArray)
- what actual Lisp type was expected  (e.g. vector)
- what actual Lisp type was received (e.g. list )

3. Debugging code is implemented by #ifdef spread throughout the code
making it hard to read.

4. Debugging code no longer compiles.

5. There is no test suite for scriptfu
