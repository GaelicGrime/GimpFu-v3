2.99 Enhance Scriptfu add "deprecation" to allow calls to obsolete PDB procedures

Currently, some Scheme scripts in the 2.99 repo are broken calling obsolete PDB procedures.
#5426

This patch is one way to fix #5426.
I opened this issue separately because you could fix #5426 without the patch.
See "alternative" below

## What the patch does

The patch lets Scriptfu scripts call obsolete PDB procedures.
It only affects Scriptfu.
No compatibility procedures are added to the PDB.

There is a map in the patch that might need changes as 2.99 is changed
(and the map is my best effort, someone else more involved should review it
and compare to the docs in devel-docs/.../removed_functions.md)
The warnings go to the console, they are g_warning().

The patch allows scripts to call procedures (deprecated) that
are actually already obsoleted in the 2.99 PDB (do not exist.)
The patch arranges that new procedures having the same signature are called.
It only maps names, not arguments.
For example gimp-image-is-valid(int) => gimp-image-id-is-valid(int)
(libgimp has gimp-image-is-valid(object), but not the PDB.)

## Alternative

An alternative would be to just fix the scripts in the GIMP repo.
But that leaves third party plugins in the cold.
A tradition is that GIMP deprecates for a certain period.
That is, warn of imminent obsoletions by warning "this is deprecated."
(See comments by Kevin Cousins to #5426.)
So for example, the deprecations of this patch can continue until say 3.1.
Yes, we should fix the scripts in the repo soon,
but for now, they are a good test case for this patch.

Again, the patch does not change the PDB.
The patch can be easily turned off (comment out a few lines.)
Part of the patch is isolated in a new file script-fu-compat.c
that can be easily deleted in the future.

## Former deprecation code  in ScriptFu

The patch also includes a minor change to code around "permissive".
Evidently there was a similar thing done in some prior major or minor
version change of GIMP, that allowed certain PDB procedures (taking no formal args)
to be called with actual args.
The patch clarifies that code.
More importantly, it now gives a g_warning so that one can know
the permission was given.
Heretofore, it seems to have been silent.
After some period of time and experience,
it might be that the permissiveness can be turned off also
(as well as the deprecation of this patch.)

I briefly looked in the repo history for prior compatibility code in ScriptFu
but could not easily find it.

This patch was partly implemented using similar code to that used to implement
permissiveness (a few wrapper Scheme functions, see --gimp-proc-db-call)

## Another idea

I wrote a plugin (in the PDB) that knows which PDB procedure names are deprecated.
That is, the PDB can be introspected for its own deprecated name map.
I found the first stab at the plugin didn't quite fit with ScriptFu.
But it might still be useful.
In the future, such a plugin could return a map or dictionary (two same length string arrays.)
Then the map would be in one place.
ScriptFu could call it, and any other tool that needed to know the deprecated name map.


## Related patches

The patch is on top of the patch for #6255. (Please apply it first.)

I next plan to fix the patch already submitted for #5402,
so please let me know if plans change re ScriptFu,
or if someone else plans to work on it.
