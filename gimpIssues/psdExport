2.10.20 Export photoshop .psd fails second time w calling errors to PDB procedures, image no longer exist.

To replicate:

Summary: create and export an untitled image twice.

  File>New
  Choose OK
  File>Export as
  (expect a file chooser dialog)
  Choose Photoshop image (.psd)
  Leave name as "Untitled.psd".
  Choose Export button.
  (Expect it to succeed.)

  Close image.

  Repeat the above  through Choose Export button
  Expect "do you want to replace" dialog.
  Choose Replace button.

  Expected result:  file saved.
  Actual result: Gimp message dialog box showing:
  Calling error for procedure 'gimp-item-get-image' value '3' for item #1.  ... out of range... repeated 2 times.
  Calling error for procedure 'gimp-item-get-precision' invalid ID for argument 'image'.  Most likely... image doesn't exist any longer... repeated 2 times.

I tested both:

  Ubuntu 16.04, a flatpak Gimp 2.10.20, updated today.
  In a container, Ubuntu 19.10, a self-built version of Gimp 2.10.20.

Only seems to happen for .psd, works OK with .png.
