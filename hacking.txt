Notes for developers of this package.


Disambiguation

The gimpfu module is only a part of PyGimp.
Other parts are the gimpui, etc. (I am not sure of the list).
This is about gimpfu module.
The gimpfu module imports some of the other modules.
It might be that gimpfu can be ported (for many usecases)
without porting the other modules.


Requirements

Ideally this package would do everything documented by:

The user's guide for PyGimp:
https://www.gimp.org/docs/python/pygimp.html

The v2 code:
see the Gimp repository say for v2.10
in the plug-ins/pygimp directory



Strategy

v2 used static binding to Gimp.
v3 uses dynamic binding with GI (GObject Introspection)



Decorator pattern

Makes heavy use of "dynamic decorator pattern".
See https://python-patterns.guide/gang-of-four/decorator-pattern/


Other

Some functionality of v2 has migrated to Gimp:
  "defaults" aka "persistent settings" now in Gimp as procedure_config
  Thus gimpshelf module is obsolete.

Some modules of v2 might be little used and thus not ported immediately:
????
   gimpthumb     thumbnail i.e. previews???
   gimpcolor, gimpui     ????
