Notes for developers of this package.


Disambiguation

The gimpfu module is only a part of PyGimp.
Other parts are the gimpui, etc. modules (I am not sure of the list).
This is about gimpfu module.
The gimpfu module imports some of the other modules.
It might be that gimpfu can be ported (for many usecases)
without porting the other modules.


Requirements

Ideally this package would do everything documented by:

The user's guide for PyGimp:
https://www.gimp.org/docs/python/pygimp.html

The v2 code:
see the Gimp repository say for v2.10
in the plug-ins/pygimp directory



Strategy

v2 used static binding to Gimp (binding written in C)
v3 uses dynamic binding with GI (GObject Introspection)



Decorator pattern

Makes heavy use of "dynamic decorator pattern".
See https://python-patterns.guide/gang-of-four/decorator-pattern/


Guide to source files

gimpfu_gimp
gimpfu_pdb

Provide the aliases "gimp" and "pdb" which GimpFu has always promised,
more or less to Gimp and Gimp.pdb

gimpfu_image
gimpfu_layer
etc.

Are wrappers which provide additional convenience methods provided by GimpFu v2.
They adapt Gimp.Image, Gimp.Layer, etc.

gimpfu_types  private Python types to GimpFu

gimpfu_maps   supports PF_ constants
gimpfu_widgets supports generation of GUI for a plugin

In v2 these were inside gimpfu.py

gimpfu_enums  provided Gimp enums to GimpFu authors

In v2 a C language module gimpenumsmodule.c


Other

Some functionality of v2 has migrated to Gimp:
  "defaults" aka "persistent settings" now in Gimp as procedure_config
  Thus gimpshelf module is obsolete.

Some modules of v2 might be little used and thus not ported immediately:
????
   gimpthumb     thumbnail i.e. previews???
   gimpcolor, gimpui     ????
