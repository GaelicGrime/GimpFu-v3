How to Test


Two kinds of plugins:
   - gimpfu: uses plugin convenience: imports gimpfu
   - pygimp: uses object convenience wrappers: imports gimp
   - new Gimp 3 Python 3 plugins: use GI alone.
That is:
  - not all Python Gimp plugins import GimpFu
  - PyGimp is no longer required to create a Gimp plugin in Python

Kinds of tests:
   - test parsing:  that the plugin loads and executes with defaults without exception
   - test function: that the plugin has same effect on image as it did before
   - unit tests: short, dummy plugins that don't do much but exercise one feature of GimpFu

Other special tests:
  - certain modules can be used standalone? gimpui and gimpshelf
